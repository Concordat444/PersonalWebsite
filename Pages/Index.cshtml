    <p>
        Hello and welcome to my demo website. I'm James Reed and, as the title hopefully suggests, this website exists
        for me to provide <a href="/AboutMe" target="_blank">information about myself</a> and to host any
        <a href="/Demos/List" target="_blank">programming projects</a> I undertake. Everything on this website has been
        generated without the use of AI-assistance or coding tools.
    </p>
